            <p>
            I am 28 years old and was born and raised in London. <br>
            Music has always played a huge part of my life and is what I dedicated most of my early career too. <br>
            My love for music spans all genres, but the music I love the most has always been electronic dance music. <br> 
            This site represents a short collection of some of my favourite and most dispised albums. <br>

    <!-- EXERCISE 2 
            Implement a navigation bar using the bootstrap component
            This navigation bar must be linked to every section in your page
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 3
            Create a responsive section for your favourite albums.
            In this section you should have:
            - 4 albums per row when the screen is very large
            - 3 albums per row when you are on a tablet (or a smaller window)
            - 2 albums per row when you are on a small screen
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 4
            Create a section for the album review.
            Pick one of your fav albums, and create a section with:
            - Cover
            - Title
            - Band
            - Lenght
            - Genre
            - Tracklist
            - ... And whatever you think it's interesting about it!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 5
            Worst album list! Find out the music you don't really like or you find overrated and list it
            in this "hall of shame" chart!
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 6
            Do you have any musician / band you admire or you are fan of?
            This section is dedicated to him / her / them!
            Feel free to experiment in this part of the page.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 7
            Just covers!
            Create a tapestry of album pictures. Every album picture must be "square" (use CSS to do that).
            Put at least 20 covers (also repeated) to have a nice effect and see how Bootstrap handles it.
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 8
            Implement a footer with some information / social links
        -->

    <!-- EXTRA:
            EXERCISE 9
            Create album details that are going to be toggled on and off by clicking on the album image
        -->

    <!-- EXERCISE 10
            Add a button to each section. By clicking on it the section body appears (if hidden) or disappears (if visible)
        -->

    <!--
            EXERCISE 11
            Add in the footer a field that counts, on page load, how many ALBUMS are on the page 
        -->
